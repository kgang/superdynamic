# MCP OAuth DCR Client - Requirements

## Overview

Build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client that implements Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) per RFC 7591 and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (RFC 7636) to demonstrate the MCP Authorization Specification.

## Background

The [MCP Authorization Spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization) introduces authorization capabilities to the Model Context Protocol. This project focuses on Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), which enables clients to self-register with MCP servers and establish OAuth-based authenticated sessions.

### Key Challenges
- New specification (~2 months old) with minimal reference implementations
- Requires understanding the full auth callback cycle in MCP context
- Intersection of modern identity/SSO best practices with MCP protocol

## Use Case

Build a client that can:
1. Self-register to an MCP server using DCR
2. Use the negotiated `client_id` to establish OAuth connection for a user
3. Successfully invoke authenticated MCP tools

## Technical Requirements

### Must Have
- ✅ Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) implementation
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (RFC 7636)
- ✅ Mock MCP server for testing (or integration with existing server)
- ✅ At least one successful authenticated MCP tool invocation
- ✅ Demonstrate multiple MCP tool calls
- ✅ Simple CLI interface: `python client.py --server-url <url>`

### Should Have
- ⚡ OAuth token refresh handling
- ⚡ Clear error messages for authentication failures
- ⚡ Configuration file support for server URL and settings
- ⚡ Documentation of when/how to use this approach

### Nice to Have
- 📝 Comprehensive logging of auth flow
- 📝 Support for multiple authorization servers
- 📝 Token storage/caching between sessions

## Technical Constraints

- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Dependencies**: Maximum 5 PyPI packages
- **APIs**: No proprietary APIs without mock fallback
- **Portability**: Should run on standard Python environment

## Deliverables

1. **Working Client**: Python-based MCP client with DCR + OAuth
2. **Mock Server**: Test server implementing MCP auth spec (if needed)
3. **Documentation**:
   - Setup and usage instructions (README.md)
   - Architecture decisions and approach (claude.md)
   - Clear POV on when/how to use this approach
4. **Proof of Concept**: Easily runnable demo showing end-to-end flow

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Client successfully registers via DCR with server
- ✅ Client obtains OAuth authorization from user
- ✅ Client exchanges authorization code for access token (with PKCE)
- ✅ Client makes authenticated MCP tool calls
- ✅ Complete flow is documented and reproducible
- ✅ Clear understanding of when this approach is appropriate

**All success criteria met!** See `client.py` and `test_client.py` for working implementation.
